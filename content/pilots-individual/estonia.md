# Innovation in Real Estate Pilot (Tallinn, Estonia)

## Description
The Estonian Real Estate Pilot aimed to fight information asymmetry in the real estate market in Tallinn, Estonia. The pilot provides an easy way to access and visualize open data related to real estate. In order to develop the pilot, an approach based on co-creation was adopted, and the code is freely available on GitHub, [here](https://github.com/keeganmcbride/realestatepilot/). The pilot relies heavily on R and has been made available as a shinyapp for anyone to use at [this location]( https://rnd-tut.shinyapps.io/EstonianRealEstatePilotOGI/). Most data used for the pilot is freely usable and findable on the [Estonian Open Government Data Portal](www.opendata.riik.ee)
